usecase:read the employee details and fetch all details based on his role

solution:
step1: taking the employee values from user.
step2:storing it in hashmap to avoid the duplication
step3:fetching the details based upon employee role using condtion

i could have done it using jsp getting employee details and using spring MVC i could have done it this use case if i would have more time.
also i could have done it using rest api.
